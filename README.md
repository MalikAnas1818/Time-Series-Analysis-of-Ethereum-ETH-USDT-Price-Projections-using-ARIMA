# Time Series Forecasting of Ethereum (ETH/USDT) Using ARIMA
The goal of this internship project is to develop a time series forecasting model to predict the future prices of Ethereum (ETH/USDT), a leading cryptocurrency, using historical data. In the financial sector, forecasting plays a critical role in helping traders, investors, and institutions make informed decisions. The tool of choice for this analysis is the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model â€” a widely used statistical method for forecasting time series data.
Time series forecasting is especially important in volatile markets like cryptocurrencies where prices fluctuate dramatically over short periods. By building a model that can capture patterns and trends in Ethereum price movements, we can generate realistic future price estimations and enhance data-driven decision-making.
The implementation was carried out using Python in a Jupyter Notebook and deployed via Streamlit for real-time user interaction.
